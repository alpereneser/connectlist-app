# Authentication System Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a complete authentication system for the
list-sharing mobile application. The authentication system will include login, registration,
password recovery, and email verification functionality, all designed to match the existing
orange-themed UI design language.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Login

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log into my account using my email/username and password, so
that I can access my personalized content and lists.

   the user on the login screen
4. WHEN a user taps "Forgot Password" THEN the system SHALL navigate to the password recovery screen
5. WHEN a user taps "Sign up" THEN the system SHALL navigate to the registration screen
6. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL store authentication state locally
7. IF the user has "Remember Me" enabled THEN the system SHALL automatically log them in on
   subsequent app launches

### Requirement 2: User Registration

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account with my email, username, and password, so
that I can start using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

   username, email, and password
2. WHEN a user enters valid registration information THEN the system SHALL create the account and
   send a verification email
3. WHEN a user enters an email that already exists THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate
   error message
4. WHEN a user enters a username that already exists THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate
   error message
5. WHEN a user enters a weak password THEN the system SHALL display password strength requirements
6. WHEN a user successfully registers THEN the system SHALL navigate to the email verification
   screen
7. IF the user taps "Already have an account?" THEN the system SHALL navigate back to the login
   screen

### Requirement 3: Email Verification

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to verify my email address, so that I can activate my
account and ensure account security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes registration THEN the system SHALL send a verification email to the
   provided address
2. WHEN a user is on the verification screen THEN the system SHALL display the email address and
   verification instructions
3. WHEN a user taps "Resend Email" THEN the system SHALL send another verification email
4. WHEN a user enters a valid verification code THEN the system SHALL verify the account and
   navigate to the home screen
5. WHEN a user enters an invalid verification code THEN the system SHALL display an error message
6. WHEN a user taps "Change Email" THEN the system SHALL allow them to update their email address
7. IF the verification email expires THEN the system SHALL allow the user to request a new one

### Requirement 4: Password Recovery

**User Story:** As a user who forgot their password, I want to reset my password using my email
address, so that I can regain access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the forgot password screen THEN the system SHALL display an email input
   field
2. WHEN a user enters a valid email address THEN the system SHALL send a password reset email
3. WHEN a user enters an email that doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error
   message
4. WHEN a user receives the reset email THEN the system SHALL provide a secure link to reset the
   password
5. WHEN a user clicks the reset link THEN the system SHALL navigate to a new password creation
   screen
6. WHEN a user creates a new password THEN the system SHALL update the password and navigate to the
   login screen
7. IF the reset link expires THEN the system SHALL display an error and allow requesting a new link

### Requirement 5: Authentication State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to remember my login state, so that I don't have to log in
every time I open the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL store authentication tokens securely
2. WHEN a user opens the app and has valid tokens THEN the system SHALL automatically navigate to
   the home screen
3. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the login screen
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all stored authentication data
5. WHEN a user enables biometric authentication THEN the system SHALL use device biometrics for
   login
6. IF the device supports it THEN the system SHALL offer biometric login as an option

### Requirement 6: UI/UX Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication screens to match the app's design language, so
that I have a consistent and familiar experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN showing error messages THEN the system SHALL use consistent error styling and colors
4. WHEN displaying buttons THEN the system SHALL use the same button styles as other screens
5. WHEN showing loading states THEN the system SHALL use consistent loading indicators
6. WHEN displaying typography THEN the system SHALL use the same font family and sizes as the main

### Requirement 7: Security and Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want my account information to be secure and properly validated, so
that my data is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

   characters, mixed case, numbers)
2. WHEN storing authentication data THEN the system SHALL use secure storage mechanisms
3. WHEN transmitting credentials THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS encryption
4. WHEN validating email addresses THEN the system SHALL use proper email format validation
5. WHEN validating usernames THEN the system SHALL enforce character limits and allowed characters
6. WHEN handling authentication errors THEN the system SHALL not expose sensitive information
7. IF there are multiple failed login attempts THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting

### Requirement 8: Profile Management and Avatar Upload

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to view and update my profile information including my
